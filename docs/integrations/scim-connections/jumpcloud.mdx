<Subtitle>Integrate JumpCloud with Scalekit for seamless user management</Subtitle>

## Overview

This guide is designed to assist <TermTip jargon="administrator"/>s in integrating JumpCloud with
the Scalekit platform using <TermTip jargon="SCIM"/> (System for Cross-domain Identity Management)
provisioning. By following these steps, you can automate user management tasks and ensure that
access rights are consistently updated.

This registration sets up the following:

1. **Endpoint**: This is the URL where Scalekit will send requests to JumpCloud. It acts as a
   communication point between Scalekit and JumpCloud.
2. **Bearer Token**: This token is used by Scalekit to authenticate its requests to the endpoint,
   ensuring that requests are secure and authorized.

By setting up these components, you enable seamless synchronization between JumpCloud and Scalekit.

## Create an Endpoint and API Token

Open the <TermTip jargon="Admin Portal"/> and navigate to "SCIM Provisioning." Click on "Edit" to
configure your settings.

## Enable Sending and Receiving Events in Provisioning Settings

In your JumpCloud admin panel, navigate to the relevant settings that allow Scalekit to send and
receive events. This includes copying any necessary Endpoint URLs and Bearer Tokens from Scalekit
into JumpCloud.

:::tip Make sure to organize your users into groups for easier management and assignment of
permissions. :::

## Verification

After completing these steps, verify that users and groups are successfully synced between Scalekit
and JumpCloud. Check for any errors or issues in the connection logs.
