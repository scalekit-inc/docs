# JumpCloud Directory

<Subtitle>Integrate JumpCloud with Scalekit for seamless user management</Subtitle>

## Overview

This guide is designed to assist <TermTip jargon="administrator"/>s in integrating JumpCloud with
the Scalekit platform using <TermTip jargon="SCIM"/> provisioning. By following these steps, you can
automate user management tasks and ensure that access rights are consistently updated.

This registration sets up the following:

1. **Endpoint**: This is the URL where Scalekit will send requests to JumpCloud. It acts as a
   communication point between Scalekit and JumpCloud.
2. **Bearer Token**: This token is used by Scalekit to authenticate its requests to the endpoint,
   ensuring that requests are secure and authorized.

By setting up these components, you enable seamless synchronization between JumpCloud and Scalekit.

## Create an Endpoint and API Token

Open the <TermTip jargon="Admin Portal" /> from the app being onboarded and select the "SCIM
Provisioning" tab. A list of Directory Providers will be displayed. Choose "JumpCloud" as your
Directory Provider. If the Admin Portal is not accessible from the app, request instructions from
the app owner.

This action will generate an Endpoint URL and Bearer token for your organization, allowing the app
to listen to events and maintain synchronization with your organization.

## Add a New Application in JumpCloud

1. Go to the JumpCloud Admin Portal > SSO Applications and click on "+ Add New Application."

2. Create a custom application by trying to do an non-existent application search.

3. Click "Next" and choose the features you would like to enable. Since your application wants to
   provision new users and user updates from JumpCloud, select "Export users to this app (Identity
   Management)"

4. Finally, enter the general info such as display name (this example uses "Provisioning via
   Scalekit") and click "Save Application"

## Configure Provisioning Settings

Click on "Configure Application" and proceed to configure the application settings. This opens a
modal with "Identity Management" selected.

## Enable Sending and Receiving Events in Provisioning Settings

In your JumpCloud admin panel, navigate to the relevant settings that allow Scalekit to send and
receive events. This includes copying any necessary Endpoint URLs and Bearer Tokens from Scalekit
into JumpCloud.

## User and Group Assignment

To assign users to the newly integrated application:

1. Navigate to the "User Groups" section
2. Click on "+" to add users or groups as needed
3. Ensure that all necessary metadata fields are populated correctly

:::tip Make sure to organize your users into groups for easier management and assignment of
permissions. :::

## Verification

After completing these steps, verify that users and groups are successfully synced between Scalekit
and JumpCloud. Check for any errors or issues in the connection logs.
