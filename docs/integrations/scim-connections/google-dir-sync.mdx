### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during synchronization:

1. **Authorization Errors**: Ensure you have sufficient privileges to authorize us to access your users and groups information from your Google Workspace directory.
2. **Missing Users/Groups**: We automatically fetch latest users and groups from Google Workspace directory once every hour. If you would like to trigger a sync manually, use the "Sync Now" button in the Actions menu.
