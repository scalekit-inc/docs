# Google Workspace Directory

<Subtitle>
  Sync users and groups from Google Workspace to your application
</Subtitle>

## Overview

This guide helps <TermTip jargon="administrator"/>s synchronize their Google Workspace directory with an application they're onboarding to their organization. By integrating your application with Google Workspace, you can automate user management and ensure access rights remain consistently up-to-date.

The integration enables:

1. **User Synchronization**: Automatically provision users from Google Workspace to your application
2. **Group Synchronization**: Map Google Workspace groups to roles in your application
3. **Access Management**: Control who can access your application based on Google Workspace membership

Note that for nested groups, the sync will only process groups at the top level of your Google Workspace hierarchy.

## Prerequisites

- Administrator access to your Google Workspace account
- Administrator access to the application you're onboarding

## Set Up Google Workspace Directory Sync

### 1. Access the Directory Configuration Screen

Navigate to the Admin Portal of your application and select the "Directory Sync" tab. You'll see a list of available directory providers.

### 5. Sign In with Google Admin Account

You'll be redirected to Google's authentication page. Sign in with your Google Workspace administrator account. If you're already signed in with multiple accounts, select "Use another account" to ensure you're using your administrator account.

### 7. Grant Required Permissions

When prompted, review and confirm the permissions requested by the application. These permissions allow the application to read user and group information from your Google Workspace directory.

### 8. Select Groups to Sync

After authorization, you'll see the groups available in your Google Workspace directory. Select the groups you want to synchronize with your application.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during synchronization:

1. **Authorization Errors**: Ensure your Google Workspace administrator account has sufficient permissions
2. **Missing Users/Groups**: Verify that the users and groups exist in your Google Workspace directory
3. **Sync Delays**: Initial synchronization may take up to 40 minutes to complete sync. If needed you can manually trigger a sync from the Admin Portal.

For additional assistance, contact your application administrator or Scalekit support.
