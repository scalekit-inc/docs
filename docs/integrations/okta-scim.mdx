# Okta Directory (SCIM Provisioning)

<Subtitle>Sync user lists with apps during onboarding</Subtitle>

## Overview

This guide is designed to help <TermTip jargon="administrator"/>s seamlessly sync their Okta Directory with an
application they want to onboard to their organization. By integrating your application with Okta, you can automate user
management tasks and ensure that access rights are consistently up-to-date.

This registration sets up the following:

1. **Endpoint**: This is the URL where Okta will send requests to the app you are onboarding. It acts as a communication
   point between Okta and your application.
2. **Bearer Token**: This token is used by Okta to authenticate its requests to the endpoint. It ensures that the
   requests are secure and authorized.

By setting up these components, you enable seamless synchronization between your application and the Okta directory.

## Create an Endpoint and API Token

Open the <TermTip jargon="Admin Portal" /> from the app being onboarded and select the "Directory Sync" tab. A list of Directory
Providers will be displayed. Choose "Okta" as your Directory Provider. If the Admin Portal is not accessible from the
app, request instructions from the app owner.

</figure>

After selecting "Okta," click "Configure." This action will generate an Endpoint URL and Bearer token for your
organization, allowing the app to listen to events and maintain synchronization with your organization.

## Add a New Application in Okta

Log in to the Okta admin dashboard and navigate to "Applications" in the main menu.

If you haven't previously created a SCIM application in Okta, select "Browse App Catalog." Otherwise, choose it from
your existing list of applications. In the Okta Application dashboard, search for "<TermTip jargon="SCIM" /> 2.0 Test App (OAuth Bearer Token)" and select the corresponding
result.

Click "Add Integration" on the subsequent page.

Provide a descriptive name for the app, then proceed by clicking "Next."

The default configuration is typically sufficient for most applications. However, if your directory requires additional
settings, such as Attribute Statements, configure these on the Sign-On Options page. Complete the application creation
process by clicking "Done."

## Enable Sending and Receiving Events in Provisioning Settings

In your application's Enterprise Okta admin panel, navigate to the "Provisioning" tab and select "Configure API
Integration."

Copy the Endpoint URL and Bearer Token from your Admin Portal and paste them into the *SCIM 2.0 Base URL* field and *OAuth Bearer Token* field, respectively. Verify the configuration by clicking "Test API Credentials," then save the settings.

Give provisioning permissions to the API integration. This is necessary to allow Okta to send and receive events to the app. Upon successful configuration, the Provisioning tab will display a new set of options. These options will be utilized to
complete the provisioning process for your application.

actions in your application, including creating new user accounts, updating existing user information, and deactivating
user accounts when necessary.

:::tip

[Okta recommends using separate groups for push groups](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/users-groups-profiles/usgp-about-group-push.htm) and group assignments to ensure accurate membership
reflection. Without this separation, manual group pushes may be required for membership changes.

:::

After completing these steps, verify that the users and groups are successfully synced in the Administrator Portal.
