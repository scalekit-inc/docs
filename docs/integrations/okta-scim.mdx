# Okta Directory

<Subtitle>Allow user list to sync with your apps</Subtitle>

# Introduction

Sync your Okta Directory users with Scalekit. Use Scalekit to listen to events from your Directory. This lets you automate tasks like giving or removing access for users in your organization. This guide helps administrators sync their Okta Directory with an app they want to onboard.

To sync an organization's users and groups with your application and Okta directory, you need to register your application in Okta. This registration sets up the following:

1. **Endpoint**: This is the URL where Okta will send requests to the app you are onboarding. It acts as a communication point between Okta and your application.
2. **Bearer Token**: This token is used by Okta to authenticate its requests to the endpoint. It ensures that the requests are secure and authorized.

By setting up these components, you enable seamless synchronization between your application and the Okta directory.
