## Frequently Asked Questions

### What Identity Providers are supported for SSO?

SSO includes native, prebuilt integrations with all identity providers including Okta, Entra ID (Azure AD), JumpCloud, Google SSO, and more. Works out-of-box with SAML and OIDC.

### What directories are supported for SCIM?

Scalekit provides a single API with a unified data format for multi-directory integration. SCIM solution includes corporate directories and HRMS systems like Okta, Azure AD, Rippling, Google Workspace, and more. For directories that do not offer native SCIM support, we provide batch APIs for user provisioning.

### What’s Admin Portal?

Admin Portal enables your customers to self-serve manage SSO and SCIM configurations, thus reducing engineering and support overhead for your team. Using Admin Portal, IT admins (in your customers’ organizations) can set up authentication connections, test SSO flows, map custom user attributes, and more. The portal can be embedded into your app with a fully branded UI or shared as a standalone link.

### How does Scalekit handle multi-tenancy?

Scalekit is designed with native multi-tenancy and follows organization-first data model. Each organization in your app can have its own authentication policies, SSO/SCIM configuration—without requiring custom code.

### Does Scalekit support both SP-initiated and IdP-initiated SSO?

Yes, we support both SP-initiated and IdP-initiated SSO flows for seamless enterprise authentication.

### Can I test SSO flows before going live?

Yes, Scalekit provides a built-in IdP simulator to validate SSO flows in a sandbox environment without affecting production. No real IdP accounts are needed. Test real-world edge cases and simulate error scenarios before deployment.

### What user attributes can be mapped through SSO and SCIM?

Scalekit supports both default and custom attributes. You can define custom attributes and roles in your app and map them from identity providers (SSO) and directories (SCIM). This is a self-serve configuration, manageable by both your team and your customers.

### What deployment options are available?

Scalekit is a multi-tenant auth platform hosted on public cloud infrastructure. Each of your workspace and environment is logically isolated, ensuring strict data security and access controls.
