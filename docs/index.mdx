# What's in Scalekit?

<Subtitle>

Scalekit lets you add essential enterprise features such as Single sign-
on (SSO) and SCIM provisioning to your app without custom coding or
complex configurations. It integrates with all the major IdPs and
customer directories, giving you the flexibility to offer secure, friction-
free authentication to your customers

</Subtitle>

Here is a glance at all that you can do with Scalekit:

- **Simplify Single Sign-On (SSO):** Connect with identity providers your customers already use, simulate scenarios, and resolve errors before go-live
- **Auto provision with SCIM:** Sync with different customer directories without custom code, enabling auto-provisioning, de-provisioning, and automated role assignment in real-time
- **Streamline Social Logins:** Offer multiple social logins seamlessly and securely with one simplified OIDC integration
- **Enable customer config with Admin Portal:** Empower customers to configure their own auth settings for both SSO and SCIM without having to repeat your efforts
