# Admin Portal

<Subtitle>Empower your customers to configure and manage SSO connections by themselves</Subtitle>

The Admin Portal is a self-service interface designed to empower your customers' IT admins to configure SSO independently, thereby reducing the overhead on your engineering and support teams. Fully hosted and managed by Scalekit, the admin portal simplifies the SSO setup process with comprehensive IdP-specific documentation, ensuring a fast and secure integration with just a few lines of code.

Depending on your preferences, you can choose one of the two ways to integrate the Admin Portal into your application:

1. Setup via API (or Integrate via API)
2. No-code Portal

## 1. Setup Admin Portal via API:

### Configure SDK

Begin by installing the Scalekit SDK, which provides necessary tools for creating a secure and efficient connection to the Admin Portal.

<InstallSDK />

Use the Generate Portal Link API to generate an Admin Portal link that is uniquely keyed to an organization. You can either embed this as an iframe in your application or redirect the user to this link for the admin to self serve configure SSO for their organization.

<Tabs groupId="tech-stack">
<TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```javascript showLineNumbers
const link = await sc.organization.generatePortalLink("org_1233222");

// link.location is the Admin Portal url
```

 </TabItem>
 <TabItem value="py" label="Python">

 ```python showLineNumbers
 # generate admin portal link by sending organization id as a parameter
 link = sc.organization.generate_portal_link('org_1233222')

 # link['location'] is the Admin Portal url

 ```

 </TabItem>
 <TabItem value="golang" label="Go">

 ```go showLineNumbers
 // generate admin portal link by sending organization id as a parameter
 link, err := sc.Organization.GeneratePortalLink(
   ctx,
   "org_1233222",
 )

 // link.Location is the Admin Portal url
 ```

 </TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Note**:

- This link is designed for one-time use, expiring after 5 minutes or upon its initial access.
- Once activated, the IT admin can configure SSO for a longer period of time. The session will remain active until the setup is complete.
- Depending on your UX strategy, you may choose to redirect the IT admin to this link or embed it within your application as an iframe, allowing configuration without navigating away from your product.

## 2. No-Code Admin Portal

Log in to your Scalekit Dashboard and navigate to the desired organization's overview section.

</figure>

<!-- <Show screenshot> -->

Click 'Generate Link' to create a new, shareable Admin Portal link.

- This link is valid for 7 days but can be revoked at any time from the dashboard for security purposes.
- The link can be distributed through communication channels such as email, Slack, etc
- Exercise caution, as anyone with this link can view and update their organization's SSO settings
