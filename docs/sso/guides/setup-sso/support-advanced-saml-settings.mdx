# Advanced SAML Settings

Certain customers might necessitate the configuration of advanced SAML settings for integration with their identity provider. This process involves your application, known as the Service Provider (SP), supporting the signing of SAML requests using a public/private key pair.

This feature is currently in private beta. If you would like to participate in testing, we invite you to contact us at support@scalekit.com.
