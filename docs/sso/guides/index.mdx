| Add SSO to your Login Page     | Redirect users from your app's login page to the IdP's authorization URL, enabling a smooth SSO experience.                   |
| Fetch User Attributes from IdP | Fetch user attributes from the IdP upon successful SSO authentication, allowing your app to access rich user profile data.    |
| Handle Raw Attributes from IdP | Process the IdP's response as-is, without Scalekit's normalization.                                                           |
| Customize User Attributes      | Enrich the user data your app receives by configuring the IdP to include additional custom attributes tailored to your needs. |
| Brand-Aligned Admin Portal     | Customize the domain, logo, and other visual elements to create an admin portal that seamlessly matches your app's branding.  |
| Implement IdP Initiated SSO    | Handle SSO journeys initiated directly from the IdP, ensuring a consistent experience starting from either end.               |
| Customize SAML Assertions      | Fine-tune your IdP integration with customizable SAML assertions                                                              |
