# Test SSO

  Verify SSO Connection using Scalekit's Test Identity Provider
</Subtitle>

Using our [Quickstart guide](@docs/sso/quickstart), you would have integrated Scalekit and implemented the SSO authentication in your sandbox environment. Now, it's time to test your SSO integration for all possible customer scenarios.

To enable Single Sign-On (SSO) in your application, you must configure it to authenticate users through their organization's Identity Provider (IdP), such as Okta or Microsoft Entra ID. As a developer, you will need to perform some setup steps typically handled by an IT administrator, including registering your app with the IdP and configuring the necessary endpoints and credentials.

Scalekit simplifies SSO testing for developers by providing two key components:

- A "Test Organization" that allows you to simulate signing into your application as a user with email domains "@example.com" or "@example.org" (e.g., yoga_guru@example.org).
- A "Test IdP" that implements the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol and sends the necessary user profile details to your application.

## Scenario 1: Service Provider (SP) Initiated SSO

User initiates SSO from your app.

We want to validate:

- Scalekit redirects the user to the appropriate identity provider based on the Authorization URL.
- Your application can retrieve the user details by exchanging the `code` you received in the above step.
