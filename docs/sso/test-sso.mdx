# Test SSO

  Verify SSO Connection
</Subtitle>

Using our [Quickstart guide](@docs/sso/quickstart), you would have integrated Scalekit and implemented the SSO authentication in your sandbox environment. Now, it's time to test your SSO integration for all possible customer scenarios.

To enable Single Sign-On (SSO) in your application, you must configure it to authenticate users through their organization's Identity Provider (IdP), such as Okta or Microsoft Entra ID. As a developer, you will need to perform some setup steps typically handled by an IT administrator, including registering your app with the IdP and configuring the necessary endpoints and credentials.

Scalekit simplifies SSO testing for developers by providing two key components:

- A *Test Organisation* that you can use to test singing into your app as a user with email domains <SimpleCode>@example.com</SimpleCode> or <SimpleCode>@example.org</SimpleCode>. For example, <SimpleCode>yoga_guru@example.org</SimpleCode>
- An *IdP Simulator* that implements OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol and sends your app the profile details.

Use these components to test for the following scenarios.

## Scenario 1: Service Provider (SP) Initiated SSO
(a.k.a Service Provider (SP) initiated SSO )

It's the most common scenario where users comes to your app, and your app initiates the Single Sign On.

Here's a recap:

User initiates SSO from your app.

We want to validate:

- Scalekit redirects the user to the **appropriate** identity provider based on the Authorization URL.
- Your application can retrieve the user details by exchanging the `code` you received in the above step.
