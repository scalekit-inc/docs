# Customize the Admin Portal

  Configure your Admin Portal UI to match your brand and design needs.
</Subtitle>

Customizing your Admin Portal ensures that the interface aligns with your application's brand identity. Follow this guide to update your custom domain, upload your logo, adjust colors, and set a faviconâ€”all of which create a seamless user experience.

## Custom Domain

Custom domains enable you to offer a fully branded experience. By default, Scalekit assigns a unique endpoint URL, but you can replace it via CNAME configuration. This new URL becomes the base path for:

- The Admin Portal where your customers recognize your brand.
- SSO and SCIM configuration details for setting up connections to Identity Providers.
- The Scalekit REST API Endpoints used by your applications.

**Example:**

| Before                                                               | After                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <SimpleCode>https:<span></span>//yourapp.scalekit.com</SimpleCode>                | <SimpleCode>https:<span></span>//auth.yourapp.com</SimpleCode>                |

:::info
- **Integrations:** All existing integrations remain unaffected by the new CNAME URL if they were configured before the change with previous configuration.
- **Environment:** CNAME configuration is available only for production environments.
- **SSL:** After successful CNAME configuration, an SSL certificate for your custom domain is automatically provisioned.

### Add a CNAME Record

To set up your custom domain:

1. Go to your domain's DNS Registrar.
2. Add a new record to your DNS settings and select **CNAME** as the record type.
3. Copy the **Name** (your desired subdomain) from the Scalekit Dashboard and paste it into the **Name/Label/Host** field in your DNS Registrar.
4. Copy the **Value** from the Scalekit Dashboard and paste it into the **Destination/Target/Value** field in your DNS Registrar.
5. Save the record in your DNS Registrar. Note that CNAME record changes can take up to 72 hours to propagate, although they typically happen much sooner.
6. In the Scalekit Dashboard, click **Verify**.

If there are any issues during the CNAME verification step:
- Double-check your DNS configuration to ensure all values are correctly entered.
- Once the CNAME changes take effect, Scalekit will automatically provision an SSL certificate for your custom domain. This process can take up to 24 hours.

You can click on the **Check** button in the Scalekit Dashboard to verify SSL certification status. If SSL provisioning takes longer than 24 hours, please contact us at [support@scalekit.com](mailto:support@scalekit.com).

## Custom Theme

Personalize your Admin Portal further by matching it to your brand. The following elements can be customized:

- **Logo:** Upload and display your company logo.
- **Colors:** Adjust the accent color to harmonize with your brand palette.
- **Favicon:** Set a favicon that represents your brand identity.

These customization options help ensure that the Admin Portal feels like an integrated extension of your application.
