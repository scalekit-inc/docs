# Customize the Admin Portal

Customizing your Admin Portal ensures that the interface aligns with your application's brand identity. Follow this guide to update your custom domain, upload your logo, adjust colors, and set a favicon—all of which create a seamless user experience.

## Custom Domain

Custom domains enable you to offer a fully branded experience. By default, Scalekit assigns a unique endpoint URL, but you can replace it via CNAME configuration. This new URL becomes the base path for:

- The Admin Portal where your customers recognize your brand.
- SSO and SCIM configuration details for setting up connections to Identity Providers.
- The Scalekit REST API Endpoints used by your applications.

**Example:**

| Before                                                               | After                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <SimpleCode>https:<span></span>//yourapp.scalekit.com</SimpleCode>                | <SimpleCode>https:<span></span>//auth.yourapp.com</SimpleCode>                |

:::info
Once your custom domain is set up, here’s what you need to know:
- **Integrations:** All existing integrations remain unaffected by the new CNAME URL if they were configured before the change with the previous configuration.
- **Environment:** CNAME configuration is available only for production environments.
- **SSL:** After a successful CNAME configuration, an SSL certificate is automatically provisioned for your custom domain.

### Add a CNAME Record

To set up your custom domain:

- Go to **Customization > Custom Domain** in your Scalekit Dashboard and follow the setup steps
- Add a CNAME record in your domain’s DNS settings. For example, if your project’s default domain is <SimpleCode>https:<span></span>//yourapp.scalekit.com</SimpleCode>, then:
  - Create a CNAME record for <SimpleCode>auth.yourapp.com</SimpleCode> that resolves to <SimpleCode>yourapp.scalekit.com</SimpleCode>.
  - Use the recommended TTL value to ensure changes propagate quickly.
  - Check that your DNS registrar doesn’t append extra domain names. If redundant parts are added (e.g., <SimpleCode>auth.yourapp.com.yourapp.com</SimpleCode>), update it to use only the appropriate prefix (e.g., <SimpleCode>auth</SimpleCode>).

## Custom Theme

Personalize your Admin Portal further by matching it to your brand. The following elements can be customized:

- **Logo:** Upload and display your company logo.
- **Colors:** Adjust the accent color to harmonize with your brand palette.
- **Favicon:** Set a favicon that represents your brand.

These customization options help ensure that the Admin Portal feels like an integrated extension of your application.
