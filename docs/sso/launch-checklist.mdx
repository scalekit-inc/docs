# Launch checklist

<Subtitle>
    Check these recommended steps before taking SSO in production
</Subtitle>

As you get ready to deploy your Single Sign-On (SSO) implementation to production, it's important to double-check that everything is properly configured for optimal security and a seamless user experience. The checklist below outlines recommended steps to ensure your SSO integration is robust, efficient, and maintainable in a live environment.

{/* <div className="page_right_hint">

As you go through the checklist below, feel free to tick off the items that you know you have already worked-on. We will persist your status so that you can track your progress to production deployment easily.

<LabeledCheckbox id="1"> **Use appropriate environment variables** </LabeledCheckbox>

Switch from development to production credentials, including the client ID, client secret, and environment URL.

<LabeledCheckbox id="2"> **Secure the client secret** </LabeledCheckbox>

Your client secret is akin to a key to your application. Secure it with the utmost care. Go through our [best practices guide](/sso/guides/key-concepts/manage-client-secrets) to learn how to manage the client secrets safely and securely.

<LabeledCheckbox id="3"> **Verify redirect URI configuration** </LabeledCheckbox>

Double-check your redirect URI settings in the production environment to ensure they point to the correct endpoints. For guidelines on valid configurations, visit our [Redirect URI configuration guide](/sso/guides/key-concepts/redirect-uri).

<LabeledCheckbox id="4"> **Test the single sign-on flows** </LabeledCheckbox>

Ensure that you have implemented and tested all possible single sign-on workflows between your application and your customer's identity providers. Go through our [how-to guide](/sso/test-sso) to understand all the SSO scenarios and how to validate them for production readiness. Especially, ensure you have validated for the following important business cases:

- SP initiated SSO
- IdP initiated SSO
- Errors during SSO flow

<LabeledCheckbox id="5"> **Finalize branding & theming** </LabeledCheckbox>

For a consistent and professional user experience, confirm your branding (logos, accent colors, etc) is applied to the admin portal.

<LabeledCheckbox id="6"> **Review admin portal URL** </LabeledCheckbox>

Customize the admin portal URL to match your domain (for example, <SimpleCode>https:<span></span>//sso.b2b-app.com </SimpleCode>) for a seamless brand experience. Also, remember to update <SimpleCode>.env</SimpleCode> file post-CNAME configuration.

<LabeledCheckbox id="7"> **Graceful error handling** </LabeledCheckbox>

Test your integration thoroughly across all possible edge cases, including incomplete, invalid, or duplicate data submissions.
