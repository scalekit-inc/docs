<LabeledCheckbox id="4"> **Test the Directory Sync flows** </LabeledCheckbox>

Ensure that you have implemented and tested all possible Directory Sync workflows between your application and your customer's Identity providers. Especially, ensure you have validated for the following business cases:

<LabeledCheckbox id="6"> **Review Admin Portal URL** </LabeledCheckbox>

Customize the admin portal URL to match your domain (for example, <SimpleCode>https:<span></span>//sso.b2b-app.com </SimpleCode>) for a seamless brand experience. Also, Remember to update <SimpleCode>.env</SimpleCode> file post-CNAME configuration.
