# Directory Sync Quickstart Guide

<!-- TODO: Add quickstart guide -->

Directory Sync, also known as User Provisioning or SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management), is a crucial feature for B2B applications that need to manage user accounts at scale. It allows for automatic synchronization of user data between an organization's identity provider (IdP) or directory service and your application.

## Key Benefits for B2B Application Developers

1. **Automated User Management**: Eliminate manual user creation, updates, and deletions.
2. **Improved Security**: Ensure that user access is promptly revoked when employees leave an organization.
3. **Reduced Administrative Overhead**: Minimize the need for IT admins to manage users in multiple systems.
4. **Enhanced User Experience**: Provide seamless access to your application for new employees.
5. **Scalability**: Efficiently manage user accounts for organizations of all sizes.

Directory Sync is particularly valuable when dealing with enterprise customers who have a large number of users and require streamlined user lifecycle management. By implementing Directory Sync, you can offer a more attractive solution to enterprise clients, potentially increasing adoption and reducing churn.

In the following sections, we'll guide you through the process of setting up and implementing Directory Sync in your B2B application using Scalekit.
