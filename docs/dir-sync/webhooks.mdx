# Webhooks

Webhooks are powerful tools that allow your application to receive real-time notifications about specific occurrences within the ScaleKit Directory Sync system. Events represent specific actions or changes, while webhooks are the mechanism used to deliver these event notifications to your specified endpoint.

By leveraging webhooks, you can build responsive and dynamic integrations that react immediately to changes in your directory sync data, enabling you to keep your systems in sync and automate user provisioning and deprovisioning.
