Group Based Access Control (GBAC) is a powerful feature in Scalekit that allows you to automatically assign roles to users based on their group memberships in the directory provider. This functionality streamlines the process of managing user permissions and access rights within your application.

## How GBAC Works

1. **Group Synchronization**: When a user is synchronized from the directory provider (e.g., Azure AD, Okta) to Scalekit, their group memberships are also synchronized.

2. **Role Mapping**: In Scalekit, you can define mappings between directory groups and roles in your application.

3. **Automatic Role Assignment**: Based on these mappings, Scalekit automatically assigns the corresponding roles to users when they are created or updated in the system.

## Implementing GBAC with Scalekit APIs

To implement Group Based Access Control using Scalekit APIs, follow these steps:

### 1. Configure GBAC in Scalekit Dashboard

Before implementing GBAC, you need to configure it in the Scalekit Dashboard:

1. **Enable GBAC**: As a B2B App Developer, enable GBAC for your application in the Scalekit Dashboard. This determines whether GBAC configurations will be available to IT Admins.

2. **Configure Roles**: Define all the roles applicable in your B2B application at the environment level. These roles will be available for all organizations within that environment.

   ```json
   POST /api/v1/roles
   {
     "role_name": "billing_admin",
     "role_display_name": "Billing Administrator"
   }
   ```

   - `role_name`: A unique alphanumeric string following a variable naming format (e.g., `billing_admin`).
   - `role_display_name`: A human-readable display name for the role.

3. **Set Default Role**: Choose a default role that will be assigned to users when no group-role mappings match their group memberships.

### 2. IT Admin Configuration

IT Admins can configure GBAC settings for their organization:

1. **Enable GBAC**: While setting up Directory Sync, IT Admins can choose to enable automatic role assignment based on group memberships.

2. **Group-Role Mapping**: IT Admins manually map directory groups to roles in your B2B application. Use the Scalekit API to create these mappings:

   ```json
   POST /api/v1/organizations/{org_id}/group-role-mappings
   {
     "group_id": "group_123456",
     "role_name": "billing_admin"
   }
   ```

### 3. Handling Role Assignments

When users are synchronized from the directory provider, Scalekit will automatically assign roles based on the configured mappings. You can retrieve these role assignments using the User API:
