# Automatic Role Assignment

<Subtitle>Assign App Roles from Directory Group Memberships</Subtitle>

Manually assigning roles to users in your application, such as viewer, member, editor, or admin, can
be a time-consuming task for administrators, particularly in large enterprises where access needs
frequently change. Scalekit streamlines this process by allowing administrators to establish
workflows that automatically update your app about the roles to assign to users.

## Introduction

A common strategy for managing varying access levels is to group users based on their specific
access requirements. For example, if you are developing an application similar to GitHub with roles
like maintainer, writer, and viewer, customer administrators can create user groups for each role
within their directory provider.

  App](@site/docs/scim/assets/gbra-1.png)
  <figcaption>SCIM User Provisioning Flow Directory to Scalekit to Your App</figcaption>
</figure>

Scalekit notifies your application when administrators create groups or add users to them, enabling
you to take necessary actions such as creating or modifying user roles as directed by the
organization’s administrator. Regardless of the directory provider your customers use, Scalekit
delivers normalized information, eliminating the need for data transformation across different
providers.

## Enabling Group-Based Role Assignment

To enable administrators to map groups to roles in your app:

1. Go to the Scalekit Dashboard
2. Select "SCIM Provisioning"
3. Switch to the "Role Assignment" tab
4. Create your app's roles

  ![How Scalekit works](@site/docs/scim/assets/automatically-assign-roles-4.png)

</figure>

The first role you create in your app becomes the default role automatically. This means users who
don't belong to any specific group will be assigned this role upon account creation. To change the
default role, navigate to the role settings, click the "..." menu next to the desired role, select
"Edit," and toggle the "Set as default role" option.

:::tip

Choose clear Display Names and Descriptions for your roles to help customers understand and align
with the access levels in the Admin Portal.

## Listening to Events

Scalekit continuously monitors updates from your customers’ directory providers and sends event
payloads to your application via a registered webhook endpoint. To set up these endpoints and manage
subscriptions, refer to the Scalekit Dashboard documentation.

In this scenario, you will listen for the <SimpleCode>organization.directory.user_updated</SimpleCode> event to determine a user's role from
the payload. Scalekit automatically includes a role property relevant to your app, based on the role
information configured in the Scalekit Dashboard.

See the [User Event Payload Reference](/apis#tag/Webhooks/organization.directory.user_updated) for
more information about the payload structure.

By utilizing Scalekit's group-based role assignment feature, you can simplify access management for
your enterprise customers and ensure that user roles remain synchronized with their directory
provider.
