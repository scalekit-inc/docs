# Entra ID

_Subtitle -_ Sync user lists with app being onboarded and Entra ID

# Overview

This guide is designed to help administrators seamlessly sync their EntraID directory with an
application they want to onboard to their organization. By integrating your application with Entra
ID, you can automate user management tasks and ensure that access rights are consistently
up-to-date.

This registration sets up the following:

1. **Endpoint**: This is the URL where EntraID will send requests to the app you are onboarding. It
   acts as a communication point between EntraID and your application.
2. **Bearer Token**: This token is used by Okta to authenticate its requests to the endpoint. It
   ensures that the requests are secure and authorized.

By setting up these components, you enable seamless synchronization between your application and the
EntraID directory.

# Create Endpoint and Bearer Token

Open the Admin Portal from the app being onboarded and select the "SCIM Provisioning" tab. A list of
Directory Providers will be displayed. Choose "Entra ID" as your Directory Provider. If the Admin
Portal is not accessible from the app, request instructions from the app owner.

If the "SCIM Provisioning" tab is not visible, it typically indicates that the feature is not
enabled for your organization. Contact the app owner to enable it via the Scalekit Dashboard by
navigating to Organizations > Your Organization > Enable Directory Sync.

After selecting "EntraID," click "Configure." This action will generate an Endpoint URL and Bearer
token for your organization, allowing the app to listen to events and maintain synchronization with
your organization.

# Add a New Application in EntraID

We create a new app in Microsoft Entra ID to send users related updates to app that you want to
onboard to your organization.

Go to Microsoft Azure portal and select ‚ÄúMicrosoft Entra ID‚Äù.

You should see ‚Äú+ New application‚Äù button in ‚ÄúManage > All applications‚Äù Tab. Click ‚Äú+New
application‚Äù.

Azure lists feature applications. Click ‚Äú+ Create your own application‚Äù on this page. A modal would
open up on the right hand side.

Give a name for you want to onboard. For the sake of this guide, let‚Äôs call it ‚ÄúHero SaaS‚Äù as an
example. Leave the defaults as-is and click ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù.

This will land you within the ‚ÄúHero SaaS‚Äù app‚Äôs overview. From the left sidebar select ‚ÄúManage >
Provisioning‚Äù. You should see couple of things that you can configure.

Set the Provisioning Mode to be ‚ÄúAutomatic‚Äù

In the Admin Credentials section, set Endpoint to be Tenant URL whereas Secret Token to be the
Bearer Token we generated previously.

Next comes the Mappings section. This section is used to map attributes of a user information to
Hero SaaS. At this point, we will focus on simply enabling user provisioning.

Click on ‚ÄúProvision Microsoft Entra ID Users‚Äù hyperlink and make sure ‚ÄúEnabled‚Äù field is toggled to
‚ÄúYes‚Äù.

If everything is okay, click ‚ÄúX‚Äù to close the full page modal.

Once these is all setup, reload the page for the changes to take effect and go to ‚Äú Overview >
Manage > Provisioning ‚Äú you will notice a new section appear in the modal called ‚ÄúProvisioning
Status‚Äù. Make sure it toggled to ‚ÄúOn‚Äù state.

With this Entra ID is successfully setup to send events to Hero SaaS when users are added or
removed. Let try it out.

In the Hero SaaS Application we just created, go to ‚ÄúProvision on demand‚Äù. Input any name of any
user from your user list and click ‚ÄúProvision‚Äù.

Once provisioned, you should be able to see the users in the admin portal. This gives you a brief
idea about how many users have access to the Hero SaaS app.

(screen shot of user list)

Note that you can provision or deprovision users from ‚ÄúManage > User and groups > Add user/group‚Äù.
According to Microsoft docs, it takes about 40 mins to successfully send these events to Hero SaaS
App.
