# Automated role assignment (group based access control)

<Subtitle>
    Learn how to assign roles to users in your B2B application based on their group memberships in their directory.
</Subtitle>

Group based access control (GBAC) allows you to automatically assign roles to
users based on their group memberships in the directory provider. This
functionality streamlines the process of managing user permissions and access
rights within your application based on their group memberships in their
directory.

## How GBAC works

1. **Group synchronization**: When a user is synchronized from the directory
   provider (e.g., Azure AD, Okta) to Scalekit, their group memberships are also
   synchronized.

2. **Role mapping**: In Scalekit, you can define mappings between directory
   groups and roles in your application.

3. **Automatic role assignment**: Based on these mappings, Scalekit
   automatically assigns the corresponding roles to users when they are created
   or updated in the system.

## Implementing GBAC with Scalekit APIs

To implement group based access control using Scalekit APIs, follow these steps:

### 1. Configure GBAC in Scalekit dashboard

Before implementing GBAC, you need to configure it in the Scalekit dashboard:

1. **Enable GBAC**: As a B2B app developer, enable GBAC for your application in
   the Scalekit dashboard. This determines whether GBAC configurations will be
   available to IT admins.

2. **Configure roles**: Define all the roles applicable in your B2B application
   at the environment level. These roles will be available for all organizations
   within that environment.

   ```json
   POST /api/v1/roles
   {
     "role_name": "billing_admin",
     "role_display_name": "Billing Administrator"
   }
   ```

   - `role_name`: A unique alphanumeric string following a variable naming
     format (e.g., `billing_admin`).
   - `role_display_name`: A human-readable display name for the role.

3. **Set default role**: Choose a default role that will be assigned to users
   when no group-role mappings match their group memberships.

### 2. IT admin configuration

IT admins can configure GBAC settings for their organization:

1. **Enable GBAC**: While setting up directory sync, IT admins can choose to
   enable automatic role assignment based on group memberships.

2. **Group-role mapping**: IT admins manually map directory groups to roles in
   your B2B application. Use the Scalekit API to create these mappings:

   ```json
   POST /api/v1/organizations/{org_id}/group-role-mappings
   {
     "group_id": "group_123456",
     "role_name": "billing_admin"
   }
   ```

### 3. Handling role assignments

When users are synchronized from the directory provider, Scalekit will
automatically assign roles based on the configured mappings. You can retrieve
these role assignments using the User API:
