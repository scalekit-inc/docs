# SCIM Overview

System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is an
[open standard API specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643#section-2) designed
to manage identities across cloud applications easily and scalably. The specification suite builds
upon experience with existing schemas and deployments, emphasizing:

- Simplicity of development and integration
- Application of existing authentication, authorization, and privacy models

Its intent is to reduce the cost and complexity of user management operations by providing:

- A common user schema
- An extension model; e.g., enterprise user
- Binding documents to provide patterns for exchanging this schema using HTTP

## SCIM protocol: key components

SCIM is a HTTP based protocol and uses structured
[JSON](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7159) payloads to exchange resource information
between the SCIM client and service provider. To identify the SCIM protocol resources, the
<SimpleCode>application/scim+json</SimpleCode> media type is used.

### SCIM service provider

SCIM service provider is any business application that provisions users and groups by synchronizing
the changes made in a SCIM client, including creates, updates, and deletes. The synchronization
enables end users to have seamless access to the business application for which they're assigned,
with up-to-date profiles and permissions.

Scalekit acts as the SCIM service provider on your behalf and integrates with your customer's
identity providers or directory providers (e.g. Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, etc.) to provision
users and groups.

### SCIM client

SCIM client facilitates provisioning, or managing user lifecycle events, through SCIM endpoints
exposed by the SCIM service provider. Identity providers and HRMS act as very popular SCIM clients
as they are treated as the source of truth for user identity data.

Some of the most common SCIM clients are [Okta](https://www.okta.com),
[Microsoft Entra ID (aka Azure AD)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id).

### SCIM endpoints

SCIM endpoints are the entry points to the SCIM API. They are the endpoints that the SCIM client
will call to provision users and groups.

The following are the most popular SCIM endpoints that any SCIM service provider should support:

- <SimpleCode>/Users</SimpleCode>
- <SimpleCode>/Groups</SimpleCode>

### SCIM methods

As SCIM is built on top of REST, SCIM methods are the HTTP methods that are used to perform CRUD
operations on the SCIM resources. The following are the most common SCIM methods:

- GET
- POST
- PUT
- PATCH
- DELETE

### SCIM authentication

SCIM uses OAuth 2.0 bearer token authentication to authenticate requests to the SCIM API. The token
is a string that is used to authenticate the SCIM API requests to the SCIM service provider. The
token is passed in the HTTP Authorization header using the Bearer scheme.

## SCIM resources

SCIM resources are the core building blocks of the SCIM protocol. They represent entities such as
users, groups, and organizational units. Each resource has a set of attributes that describe the
entity.

While SCIM user resource has the basic attributes of a user like email address, phone number, and
name, it is extensible by defining new JSON schemas that a service provider can choose to implement.
An enterprise user is an example of a SCIM user extension resource. Enterprise user resource has
attributes such as employee number, department, and manager which are valuable for enterprise
implementation of user management using SCIM v2.

<CodeWithHeader title="Example SCIM user representation">

<JsonViewer
  src={{
    schemas: ['urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User'],
    userName: 'bjensen',
    name: {
      givenName: 'Barbara',
      familyName: 'Jensen',
    },
    emails: [
      {
        value: 'bjensen@example.com',
        type: 'work',
        primary: true,
      },
    ],
    entitlements: [
      {
        value: 'Employee',
        type: 'role',
      },
    ],
  }}
/>

</CodeWithHeader>

### SCIM schema

SCIM schema is the core of the SCIM protocol. It is a JSON schema that defines the structure of the
SCIM resources. The following are the most common SCIM schemas:

- [Core SCIM user schema](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643#section-4.1)
- [Enterprise user schema](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643#section-4.3)
- [Group schema](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643#section-4.2)

## Putting everything together

Now that you have a high level understanding of the SCIM protocol and different components involved,
let's put everything together to take a scenario of how SCIM protocol facilitates user provisioning
from an identity provider to a SCIM service provider like Scalekit.

### Scenario: new employee onboarding

1. ACME Inc. hires a new employee, John Doe.
2. ACME Inc. adds John Doe to their Okta directory.
3. Okta send a SCIM <SimpleCode>POST /Users</SimpleCode> request to a pre-registered SCIM service
   provider (your B2B application) with John Doe's information as per the SCIM protocol.
4. You authenticate the request using the OAuth 2.0 bearer token authentication & validate the
   request payload.
5. You provision John Doe as a new user in your B2B application using the user payload.

### Scenario: employee termination

1. ACME Inc. terminates John Doe's employment.
2. ACME Inc. removes John Doe from their Okta directory.
3. Okta send a SCIM <SimpleCode>DELETE /Users/john.doe</SimpleCode> request to a pre-registered SCIM
   service provider (your B2B application) as per the SCIM protocol.
4. You authenticate the request using the OAuth 2.0 bearer token authentication & validate the
   request payload.
5. You deactivate John Doe as an existing user in your B2B application using the user payload.

### Scenario: employee transfer

1. ACME Inc. transfers John Doe to a different department.
2. ACME Inc. updates John Doe's information in their Okta directory.
3. Okta send a SCIM <SimpleCode>PATCH /Users/john.doe</SimpleCode> request to a pre-registered SCIM
   service provider (your B2B application) as per the SCIM protocol.
4. You authenticate the request using the OAuth 2.0 bearer token authentication & validate the
   request payload.
5. You update John Doe's information in your B2B application using the user payload.

<CodeWithHeader title="SCIM create user request">

```http
POST /Users HTTP/1.1
Host: yourapp.scalekit.com/directory/dir_12442/scim/v2
Accept: application/scim+json
Content-Type: application/scim+json
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SCIM_API_TOKEN

{
    "schemas":["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"],
    "userName":"bjensen",
    "externalId":"bjensen",
    "name":{
        "formatted":"Ms. Barbara J Jensen III",
        "familyName":"Jensen",
        "givenName":"Barbara"
    }
}
```

## Scalekit's SCIM implementation

Scalekit's SCIM implementation is built upon the principles of simplicity, security, and
scalability. It provides a normalized implementation of the SCIM protocol across different identity
providers & directory providers. This allows you to focus on integrating with Scalekit's API & leave
the complexities of SCIM protocol implementation to us. While not all directory providers implement
SCIM or support all SCIM features, Scalekit aims to abstract these complexities & provide a seamless
experience for provisioning users and groups.

### Webhooks

Scalekit supports webhooks as a mechanism to send real-time updates to your application about user
provisioning and deprovisioning events to your application as and when there are changes detected in
your customer's SCIM compliant directory providers.

We also normalize the webhook payloads across different directory providers to ensure that you can
focus on building your application without having to worry about the nuances of each directory
provider's SCIM implementations.

Refer to our [Webhooks](/scim/quickstart#realtime-user-provisioning-with-webhooks) documentation to
learn more on how you can use webhooks to listen for changes in the directory and update the user's
roles in your application.
