# Launch checklist

<Subtitle>
  Ensure these steps are completed before moving automated user provisioning to production
</Subtitle>

As you prepare to deploy SCIM provisioning, verify that all configurations are optimized for
security and user experience. The following checklist helps ensure your implementation is
production-ready and efficient.

<LabeledCheckbox id="1"> **Use appropriate environment variables** </LabeledCheckbox>

Switch from development to production credentials, including the client ID, client secret, and
environment URL.

<LabeledCheckbox id="2"> **Secure the client secret** </LabeledCheckbox>

Your client secret is akin to a key to your application. Secure it with the utmost care. Go through
our [best practices guide](/sso/guides/key-concepts/manage-client-secrets) to learn how to manage
the client secrets safely and securely.

<LabeledCheckbox id="3"> **Configure webhooks** </LabeledCheckbox>

Setup webhooks for receiving real-time updates on user and group changes. Follow our
[webhook security guide](/scim/webhooks) to learn how to secure your webhooks.

<LabeledCheckbox id="4"> **Test provisioning flows** </LabeledCheckbox>

Ensure that you have implemented and tested all possible SCIM provisioning workflows such as:

- User provisioning
- User de-provisioning
- User profile update
- Group membership changes
- Role assignments

<LabeledCheckbox id="5"> **Finalize branding & theming** </LabeledCheckbox>

For a consistent user experience, ensure your branding (logo, colors) are added to the admin portal

<LabeledCheckbox id="6"> **Review admin portal URL** </LabeledCheckbox>

Customize the admin portal URL to match your domain (for
example,<SimpleCode>https:<span></span>//admin.hero-saas.app</SimpleCode>) for a seamless brand
experience. Also, remember to update <SimpleCode>.env</SimpleCode> file post CNAME configuration.
Read [customizing the admin portal](/scim/domain-and-theme-customization) on how to match your
brand.

<LabeledCheckbox id="7"> **Graceful error handling** </LabeledCheckbox>

Test thoroughly across all possible edge cases, including incomplete, invalid, or duplicate data.
