# Map user attributes

Custom attributes are admin-defined data properties that can tailor and enhance user experiences in
your application. They allow you to personalize content, features, and functionalities based on
specific user characteristics or preferences.

For example, if your <TermTip jargon="app" /> offers analytics dashboards, you can show relevant
dashboards based on each employee's department. However, your customer's directory provider might
label this attribute as <SimpleCode>employee_department</SimpleCode>, while your app expects

<SimpleCode>department</SimpleCode> in the payload.

Scalekit solves this problem by letting customers map their attribute names to the ones your app
expects.

Before you start, ensure the <TermTip jargon="Directory Sync" /> module is enabled for your
customers:

1. Select "Organizations" from the left sidebar
2. Choose the organization
3. Go to the "Directory sync" tab
4. Enable directory sync

## Enable attribute mapping

Declare the attributes your B2B SaaS app expects in the Scalekit dashboard. Scalekit will then
collect these attributes from the customer's directory provider and send them to your app.

1. In the Scalekit dashboard, select "User attributes" from the left sidebar
2. Choose "Directory sync" attributes
3. Click "Add attribute" to create a new attribute

  <figcaption>

</figure>

Once saved, this attribute will be available for your customers to map to their directory provider
attributes.

## Map custom attributes

After declaring the expected attributes in the Scalekit dashboard, your customers can map them to the
directory provider attributes.

Refer to the [Admin portal](./admin-portal.mdx) section to learn more about the admin portal and how
to share a link to it with your customers.

## Verify attribute mapping

After creating custom attributes and mapping them, verify that everything works as expected:

1. Go to the "Events" tab in the Scalekit dashboard
2. Send a test event to confirm the new attributes are sent to your app

By following these steps, you can ensure that your <TermTip jargon="B2B app" /> receives the custom
attributes it needs to deliver personalized experiences to your customers' users.
