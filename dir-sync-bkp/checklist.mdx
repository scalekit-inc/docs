</Subtitle>

As you get ready to deploy SCIM Provisioning to production, it's important to
double-check that everything is properly configured for optimal security and a
seamless user experience. The checklist below outlines recommended steps to
ensure your SCIM Provisioning implementation is robust, efficient, and
maintainable in a live environment.

{/* // This slightly appears redundant. Hence commented out for now.

As you go through the checklist below, feel free to tick off the items that you know you have already worked-on. We will persist your status so that you can track your progress to production deployment easily.

<LabeledCheckbox id="1"> Use appropriate environment variables </LabeledCheckbox>

Switch from development to production credentials, including the Client ID,
Client Secret, and Environment URL.

<LabeledCheckbox id="2"> Secure the Client Secret </LabeledCheckbox>

Your client secret is akin to a key to your application. Secure it with the
utmost care. Go through our
[best practices guide](/sso/guides/key-concepts/manage-client-secrets) to learn
how to manage the client secrets safely and securely.

<LabeledCheckbox id="3"> Configure Webhooks </LabeledCheckbox>

Ensure you have configured webhooks to receive real-time updates on user and
group changes. Please go through our
[webhook security guide](/dir-sync/webhooks) to learn how to secure your
webhooks.

<LabeledCheckbox id="4"> Test the Provisioning flows </LabeledCheckbox>

Ensure that you have implemented and tested all possible SCIM provisioning
workflows between your application and your customer's Identity providers.
Especially, ensure you have validated for the following business cases:

- Automated User Provisioning
- Automated User De-provisioning
- Automated User Profile Update
- Automated Group Membership Update
- Automated User Role Assignment

<LabeledCheckbox id="5"> Finalize Branding & Theming </LabeledCheckbox>

For a consistent and professional user experience, confirm your branding (logos,
accent colors, etc) is applied to the admin portal.

<LabeledCheckbox id="6"> Review Admin Portal URL </LabeledCheckbox>

Customize the admin portal URL to match your domain (for example,
<SimpleCode>https:<span></span>//admin.hero-saas.app </SimpleCode>) for a
seamless brand experience. Also, Remember to update
<SimpleCode>.env</SimpleCode> file post CNAME configuration. Read
[customizing the admin portal](/dir-sync/domain-and-theme-customization) on how
to match your brand.

<LabeledCheckbox id="7"> Graceful Error Handling </LabeledCheckbox>

Test your integration thoroughly across all possible edge cases, including
incomplete, invalid, or duplicate data submissions.
